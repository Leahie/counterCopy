# counterCopy
From Vanilla Js Projects Copied/Trying to learn it 
I learned btn.addEventListener("click", function(e){
}) makes the function learn from it 
e.currentTarget.classList; is the current status of what is being clicked 
.contains("") is sort of like if the classList contains this, I assume classList=a list of the classes
